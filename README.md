## **Book Management with Spring Boot 📚**

Welcome to the REST API Books project, an application developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework. This application provides a book management service through a RESTful API interface.

### Technologies Used 🚀

- **Java and Spring Boot:** The project was developed using the Java programming language and the Spring Boot framework to create efficient web services.

- **JPA and Spring Data:** Data persistence is managed through Java Persistence API (JPA) along with Spring Data, simplifying CRUD operations on the database.

- **JUnit and MockMvc:** Unit tests are implemented using JUnit and MockMvc, highlighting attention to code quality through automated verification.

- **Spring Dependency Injection:** Dependency management is implemented with Spring's dependency injection, following the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC).

### Project Architecture 🏗️

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, clearly organizing business logic, presentation, and API request handling.

### RESTful APIs 🌐

RESTful APIs are handled through Spring Web, using annotations such as `@GetMapping` and `@PutMapping`. You can interact with the application to perform CRUD operations on books.

### Repository Management 📁

Data management is streamlined thanks to Spring Data JPA and the use of dedicated repositories to interact with the database.

### Integration Testing 🧪

Integration tests are developed with MockMvc, ensuring the verification of the application's complete functionality.
